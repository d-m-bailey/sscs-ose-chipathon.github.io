# Design tools

* The PDK for our target design is available [here](https://github.com/google/gf180mcu-pdk).  
* The chipathon requires the use of open-source software (no proprietary tools)
* There are various options for design tool installation
  * The JKU Docker container: [GitHub link](https://github.com/hpretl/iic-osic-tools)
  * Conda install scripts provided by @proppy: [GitHub link](https://github.com/proppy/conda-eda/releases/)
You can run the installer this way:
``` 
curl -L -o /tmp/silicon-installer.sh https://github.com/proppy/conda-eda/releases/download/v0.0-1430-g1a959d6/mixed-signal.gf180mcuc-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash /tmp/silicon-installer.sh -p silicon-env -b
source silicon-env/bin/activate
```
 **Note**: Be sure to check the latest or recommended [conda EDA release](https://github.com/proppy/conda-eda/releases/). Please refer to the [conda EDA documentation](https://hdl.github.io/conda-eda/).
