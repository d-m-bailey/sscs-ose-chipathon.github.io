# Abstract
In this proposal, a 5-Bit SAR ADC is proposed along with the methodology for its extension into a 12-Bit SAR ADC 
for the “Lab Bench on a Chip”, achieving the sampling rate of 1.5 MS/s, Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) of over 9 and 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 55dB, while maintaining input capacitance of below 5pF. 
The design was simulated in cadence with 130nm PDK which is to be mapped onto the open-source tools Xschem, Magic. 
The fulfillment of targeted specifications will be made sure on the open-source tools as the next step of this project
