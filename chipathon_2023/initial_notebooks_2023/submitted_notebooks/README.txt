In this proposal, a 12-Bit SAR ADC is proposed. For this proposal, 5-Bit SAR ADC is simulated and presented in this proposal along with the methodology for its extension into a 12-Bit SAR ADC for the “Lab Bench on a Chip”, achieving the sampling rate of 1.5 MS/s, Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) of over 9 and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 55dB while maintaining input capacitance of below 5pF. The SAR ADC uses Anderson Logic as its Digital Block since it the simplest to use as well as the ease of extendibility it provides. As for the DAC, binary weighted DAC is used in the simulation of 5-Bit SAR ADC, which is to be changed to C-2C DAC for the 12-Bit architecture. C-2C capacitor array can offer less capacitance at the input which is desirable to meet 5pF input capacitance requirement for the ADC. The design was simulated in 130nm PDK in Cadence Tools which is to be mapped onto the open-source tools XSCHEM, Magic. The fulfillment of targeted specifications will be made sure on the open-source tools as the next step of this project.
