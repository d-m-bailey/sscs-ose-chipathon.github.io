In this proposal, we designed a Tunable Clock Generator based Phase Locked Loop (PLL), which consists of a Phase Detector (PD), Loop Filter (LP), Oscillator, and Clock Dividers. These components work in harmony to achieve stable and accurate phase synchronization. The design features include a 2nd order loop filter and VCO with a differential output frequency of 180-200 MHz and 90-110 MHz for the ADC and DAC of the Lab bench as for Analog Discoveries. It achieves a jitter of 500 fs and phase noise less than -100dBc/Hz at 1MHz. The design has been implemented and simulated at 130nm, with some blocks implemented on the open-source tool "Xschem". The complete implementation using open-source tools on GF180MCU is the next step of this project.
