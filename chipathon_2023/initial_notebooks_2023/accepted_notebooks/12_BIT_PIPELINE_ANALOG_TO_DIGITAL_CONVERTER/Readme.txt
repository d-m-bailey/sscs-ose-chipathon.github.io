A low power, area efficient, and fast response 12-bit resolution Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) is proposed here. The sampling rate of 12-bit 75MS/s is targeted for the proposed ADC, for which pipeline architeture is the feasible choice. The proposed design consists of a 12 pipelined stages of each 1.5 bit resolution. The ADC uses a pseudo-differential architecture and a capacitor cross-coupled sample-and-hold stage. The pipeline ADC is implemented in 130nm CMOS technology. The targeted specificaions include signal-to-noise and distortion ratio of 74.5-dB , spurious free dynamic range 88.5-dB, and 10.7 effective number of bits. The maximum differential and integral nonlinearity are 0.35 and 0.5 LSB, respectively. We have implemented a single stage of 1.5 bit on the open-source tools. The next step is to extend this to 12 bit pipeline archiecture on open source tool.
