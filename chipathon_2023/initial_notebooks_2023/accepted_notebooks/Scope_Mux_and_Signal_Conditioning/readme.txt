The proposed design aims to develop different blocks for scope multiplexer and signal conditioning unit, which is an integral part of Analog Discovery (Lab Bench on Chip). The proposed design recieves input from eight differential channels and a multiplexer selects one channel followed by a current sensor/buffer (depending upon input type). The next stage is a programmable gain amplifier followed by an ADC driver which is implemented using the folded cascode opamp, a component known for its high gain and bandwidth. The design has been implemented on the Cadence 130nm node, achieving a bandwidth of 6.52MHz at 0.5dB flatness for unity gain.ADC driver stage has also been implemented on Xschem. The next step involves mapping the whole design onto open-source tools (Xschem, Magic) to ensure all requirements are met.
