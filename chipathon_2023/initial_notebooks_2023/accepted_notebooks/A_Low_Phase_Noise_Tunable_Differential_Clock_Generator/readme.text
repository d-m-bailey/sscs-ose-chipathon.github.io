This proposal focuses on the development of an on-chip clock generator, Phase Locked Loop (PLL), specifically designed for DACs and ADCs, inspired by the capabilities of the Digilent Analog Discovery 2™. The proposed PLL design includes key components such as Phase Frequency Detector (PFD), Charge Pump, Loop Filter, Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) and N-Divider. The primary goal of the proposed PLL is to generate a low phase noise differential 200 MHz clock for ADCs and 100 MHz single-ended clock for DACs. The proposed design aims to reduce the phase noise, which is crucial for achieving a high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in data converters. The proposal presents schematic diagrams and simulation results of the entire PLL design, which achieves a low level jitter of 396.2 fsec, a phase noise of -114.3 dBc/Hz at an offset of 1 MHz frequency, a tunable frequency range of 180 MHz to 220 MHz with step size of 1 MHz, and a lock time of 4 µsec. The complete design has been implemented using TSMC 130 nm and 65 nm PDKs. At the end, simulation results for the VCO block of the PLL, implemented using the open-source tool XSCHEM, are presented. Future plan is to fully implement the PLL design on the GF180MCU PDK.
