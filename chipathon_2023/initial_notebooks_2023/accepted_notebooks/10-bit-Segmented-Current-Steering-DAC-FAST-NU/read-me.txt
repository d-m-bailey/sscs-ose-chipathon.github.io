A 10-bit segmented current steering digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is presented in this proposal.The specifications include an update rate of at least 10 MS/s, number of bits greater than 10, intermodulation distortion better than -60 dB, aligned noise spectral density with the arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) path, and a DAC bandwidth linked to the DAC's Nyquist bandwidth. To meet these requirements, a segmented current steering DAC is proposed, which combines the advantages of both binary and unary weighted DACs. The MSBs are implemented using thermometer coding(unary), and the LSBs are implemented using binary coding. Maximum DNL calculated is 0.39 LSBs and INL is -0.83 LSBs. The DAC is designed and implemented on 65nm PDK by TSMC, with a sampling frequency of 100 MHz. For the Opensource Tools, a 6-bit DAC is implemented on XSCHEM based on the same topology for demonstration. The results are as per expectations and all the 64 levels are in monotonic manner.
