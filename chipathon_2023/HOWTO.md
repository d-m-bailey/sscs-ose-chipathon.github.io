## How to Participate
- Join the “opensource-silicon” Slack space and subscribe to the [#ieee-sscs-dc-23](https://join.slack.com/share/enQtNDkxOTIwNjQ5NzQxNC1kM2JkM2ViNTk5NmVhZTJmZGJjNDE4ODNiOTc3NTFhMDRiYjhmMDA4ZTYyZGQ5ZDgwMGNkNjFmMmQ0ZmQ5Yzg3) channel. This is the Chipathon’s main communication channel. Feel free to post any questions here (about tool setup, circuit design, etc.).
- Optionally, join the Chipathon info session (see schedule below) to ask questions and learn more about the design goals and logistics.
- Create a Jupyter notebook detailing the main ideas of your design. You can choose to address a single sub-block (e.g., a programmable gain amplifier for the oscilloscope) or a more complete solution (e.g., the complete waveform generator design). For an example on how to describe a design idea using Jupyter, please see this [temperature sensor notebook](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/blob/main/docs/source/notebooks/temp-sense-gen/temp_sense_genCollab.ipynb). 
**Note: It is not necessary to create a layout at the proposal stage**.
- Create a pull request for your proposal notebook submission by the deadline stated below. Refer to the “how to submit” instructions in the Chipathon repository for further details.

## How to Submit your Notebook
Participants are required to send their [GitHub Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to this repository by: ~~May 1~~ May 8, 2023, 11:59 PM Pacific Time. 

**_Note_:** Please do not make any modifications to your Pull Request after the above deadline. All PRs will be merged after the deadline is passed.

Please use the following [Notebook Template](template_notebook_to_follow.ipynb) for your submission.

The following Notebooks could be used as a reference:
  - A [temperature sensor generator](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/blob/main/docs/source/notebooks/temp-sense-gen/temp_sense_genCollab.ipynb)
  - An [inverter](https://developers.google.com/silicon/guides/digital-inverter-openlane)
  - More silicon Notebooks hosted by [CHIPS Alliance](https://github.com/chipsalliance/silicon-notebooks)

Pull Requests are expected to be placed in the [initial_notebooks_2023 folder](initial_notebooks_2023/submitted_notebooks). To help with the review process, please follow the guidelines below:
  - Create a **subfolder** inside [initial_notebooks_2023 folder](initial_notebooks_2023/submitted_notebooks) which includes Notebooks with your project name and any files or README that are needed.
  - Spell out your team members at the top of your Notebook.
  - Add References to your work which includes Notebooks you have reused.
  - Feel free to open GitHub issues if you have any questions regarding this process.
  - Add tools versions that you recommend to run your Notebook.

Please refer to this general documentation on how to start a [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/) Notebooks.
